"""Libyan Arabic (ar-LY) phonology: the reflexes that separate a Tripoli
transcription from Modern Standard Arabic and from the other Maghrebi leaves.

The baseline is the **urban koine of Tripoli** (Tripolitania) as described by
Christophe Pereira, *Le parler arabe de Tripoli (Libye)* (2010) and his EALL
article *Tripoli Arabic* (2011). Tripoli is a historically sedentary town speech
that took on the Bedouin-type qāf [ɡ]; like other sedentary Maghrebi dialects it
has **merged the interdentals into the dental stops**. Eastern (Cyrenaican /
Benghazi) and Bedouin Libyan are more conservative — they retain the interdentals
and keep the affricate [dʒ] for ǧīm (Owens 1984, *A Short Reference Grammar of
Eastern Libyan Arabic*) — so those reflexes are kept as the ranked-second
candidates rather than dropped.

Every claim below is isolated on a real word and cited:

* Pereira (2010, 2011 EALL) — qāf [ɡ] in the town, ǧīm [ʒ] (a *sun* letter in
  Tripoli);
* Benkato (2020, *Maghrebi Arabic*, open access) — sedentary Maghrebi merged the
  interdentals with the dental stops; Maghrebi deletes vowels in light syllables
  (*katab > Tripoli ktǝb); European contact added /v, č, ǧ/ to Italian loans;
* Watson (2002) — emphasis backs adjacent /a aː/ to [ɑ ɑː];
* Owens (1984) — eastern/Bedouin Libyan retention (the second candidates).

Undiacritized abjad input carries no short vowels, so bare-consonant skeletons
transcribe without them; diacritized forms are used where a vowel is under test.

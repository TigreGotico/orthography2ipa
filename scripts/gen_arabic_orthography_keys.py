"""Generate the systematic Arabic connected-speech orthography keys.

Vocalized Arabic sentence orthography encodes several obligatory
connected-speech processes that single-letter grapheme keys cannot express.
This script derives them as maximal-munch multi-character grapheme keys and
writes them into the spec JSONs (pure data — the engine stays
language-agnostic):

1. **Sun-letter assimilation** (Ryding 2005 §2.9; Watson 2002 §2): the /l/ of
   the definite article assimilates to a following coronal, written in
   vocalized text as shadda on the sun letter (``السَّلام`` → /assalaːm/).
   Keys ``ال<S>ّ`` (and clitic + article combinations) are generated **per
   lect from that lect's own effective letter values**, so a dialect that
   shifts a sun letter (e.g. Egyptian ث → /t, s/, Badawi & Hinds 1986)
   assimilates to its own reflex. A dialect spec only receives entries that
   differ from what it inherits from Classical Arabic (arb).
2. **Proclitics + article** (Ryding 2005 §2.11): ``وَال`` /wal/, ``فَال``
   /fal/, ``بِال`` /bil/, ``كَال`` /kal/, ``لِل`` /lil/ — the hamzat-wasl alif
   of the article is silent after the clitic vowel.
3. **Tā marbūṭa liaison** (Ryding 2005 §2.5): ``ة`` followed by a vowel sign
   or tanwīn is /at .../ (``المَدْرَسَةِ`` → /almadrasati/); bare final ``ة``
   keeps the pausal /a/ (existing key).
4. **Tanwīn fatḥ + silent alif/ʼalif maqṣūra** (Ryding 2005 §2.4): the alif
   written after ً is a spelling seat, not /aː/ — ``جِدًّا`` → /dʒiddan/.
5. Fix reversed vowel-letter digraphs in arb: ``يَ`` is /ja/ (consonant +
   fatḥa), not the diphthong /aj/ (that is ``َي``); likewise ``وَ`` /wa/,
   ``يِ`` /ji/, ``وُ`` /wu/, ``اَ`` (wasl alif + fatḥa) /a/. Adds the
   glide-preserving keys ``ِيَ`` /ija/, ``ِيّ`` /ijj/, ``ُوَ`` /uwa/,
   ``ُوّ`` /uww/ so intervocalic glides survive maximal munch
   (``صَافِيَة`` → /sˤaːfija(t)/).
6. **Sandhi repairs** (arb, inherited): the hamzat-wasl elision rule deleted
   the *left* vowel instead of the article's /a/ — rewritten with
   ``right_transform``; the pausal-tanwīn rule (right context ``$``) matched
   before *every* word, deleting every final /n/ — removed (the gold style
   keeps full tanwīn); the cross-word sun-assimilation rule could only ever
   fire on a real /l/-final word before a coronal-initial word, which MSA
   does not assimilate — removed (assimilation is word-internal, handled by
   the keys above).

Idempotent: re-running produces the same specs. Run after changing any
Arabic letter mapping so the derived keys stay in sync.

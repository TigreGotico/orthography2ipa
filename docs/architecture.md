## Module Responsibilities

### `types.py`

Defines the immutable data model — `types.py:1-634`:

- `Grapheme2IPA = Dict[str, List[str]]` — orthographic key → list of IPA candidates — `types.py:20`
- `AllophoneMap = Dict[str, List[str]]` — phoneme → list of surface realisations — `types.py:23`
- `PositionalGrapheme2IPA` — grapheme → `{GraphemePosition: [IPA]}` — `types.py:26`
- `GraphemePosition` — enum of 21 positional contexts — `types.py:34`
- `AncestorRole` — enum of relationship types (PARENT, SUBSTRATE, etc.) — `types.py:142`
- `QualityTier` — data maturity enum (STUB, SKELETON, RESEARCH, PRODUCTION) — `types.py:174`
- `ScriptType` — writing system typology enum — `types.py:194`
- `LinguisticSource` — bibliographic reference dataclass — `types.py:258`
- `SandhiRule` — cross-word phonological rule dataclass — `types.py:300`
- `Ancestor` — frozen dataclass linking a code, role, and weight — `types.py:334`
- `LanguageSpec` — frozen dataclass holding all phonological data for one variety — `types.py:379`

All types are **frozen** (immutable) to allow safe caching.

### `registry.py`

Manages language code resolution and lazy loading — `registry.py:1-130`:

- `_ALIASES` — ISO 639-3 → BCP-47 alias table — `registry.py:18-40`
- `_resolve_code(code)` — normalises aliases using the table and optional `langcodes` library — `registry.py:49`
- `get(code)` — resolves aliases, loads JSON spec on demand, caches the `LanguageSpec` — `registry.py:68`
- `available_codes()` — all registered codes (from JSON files) — `registry.py:85`
- `available_families()` — codes grouped by language family — `registry.py:120`
- `get_plugin(code)` — return a G2P plugin for the code, if registered — `registry.py:111`

Lazy loading means importing `orthography2ipa` is essentially free; only requested languages are loaded.

### `json_loader.py`

Loads `LanguageSpec` objects from JSON files under `data/` — `json_loader.py:1-295`:

- `load_json_spec(code)` — load and resolve a single spec with inheritance — `json_loader.py:87`
- `load_all_json_specs()` — load all specs from the data directory — `json_loader.py:250`
- `available_json_codes()` — sorted list of all codes with JSON data files — `json_loader.py:270`

Inheritance is resolved via `graphemes_base`, `allophones_base`, and `positional_graphemes_base` fields in JSON.

### `phonetok.py`

A language-agnostic tokenizer that works entirely from a `LanguageSpec` — `phonetok.py:1-400+`:

- `TokenKind` — enum: GRAPHEME, WHITESPACE, PUNCTUATION, DIGIT, UNKNOWN, BOS, EOS — `phonetok.py:66`
- `Token` — immutable dataclass representing one tokenizer output unit — `phonetok.py:92`
- `IPAPath` — a scored candidate IPA transcription — `phonetok.py:124`
- `_GraphemeTrie` — prefix trie built from `spec.graphemes` for O(k) maximal-munch matching — `phonetok.py:188`
- `GraphemeContext` — a context-aware view over one GRAPHEME token: word-local neighbours (`prev`/`next`/`at`/`neighbors`), character `span`, and class predicates (`is_vowel`/`is_consonant`/`is_front`/`is_back`) delegating to `vowels.py`
- `TokenSequence` — an indexed view returned by `tokenize_with_context()` wrapping every GRAPHEME token in a `GraphemeContext`
- `PhonetokTokenizer` — the main class; wraps the trie — `phonetok.py:225`
  - `tokenize(text)` — produces `List[Token]`
  - `tokenize_with_context(text)` — produces a `TokenSequence` of context-aware grapheme views
  - `ipa_beam(text, beam_width)` — beam search over all IPA paths
  - `ipa_expand(tokens, include_allophones)` — expand tokens into IPA paths with optional allophone substitution

The context model (`GraphemeContext` / `TokenSequence`) is the shared substrate
on which Workstream B builds the pronunciation lattice and the downstream
rescorer seam. It gives specialized phonemizers a single, accent-aware token
context — neighbour access, spans and phonological-class predicates — to build
on instead of re-rolling per-consumer index arithmetic and private vowel sets.

### `distance.py`

The relational axes — one function per question, never collapsed into a single
similarity number. Built on the 21-feature SPE/IPA system. See
[distance.md](distance.md) for the full catalogue and each axis's caveats.

Phonological:

- `feature_vector(segment)` → 21-element float tuple
- `feature_names()` → tuple of feature name strings
- `segment_distance(a, b)` → normalized [0,1] phonetic distance
- `inventory_distance(spec_a, spec_b)` → `InventoryDistance`
- `allophone_overlap(spec_a, spec_b)` → Jaccard similarity float
- `phonological_distance(spec_a, spec_b)` → `PhonologicalDistance` (combined)
- `tone_distance(spec_a, spec_b)` → tone-inventory distance
- `phoneme_coverage(spec_native, spec_target)` → asymmetric transfer coverage

Orthographic — reading vs spelling, which are inverses of each other:

- `grapheme_divergence(spec_a, spec_b)` → `GraphemeDivergence` (same text → same sounds?)
- `spelling_divergence(spec_a, spec_b)` → `SpellingDivergence` (same sounds → same spelling?)
- `positional_divergence(spec_a, spec_b)` → positional-grapheme divergence
- `orthographic_distance(spec_a, spec_b)` → grapheme divergence folded with script distance

Genealogical, temporal, geographic:

- `ancestry_similarity(spec_a, spec_b)` → float based on shared, time-decayed ancestors
- `temporal_distance(spec_a, spec_b)` → attestation-period distance
- `geographic_distance(spec_a, spec_b, normalize=True)` → great-circle distance, or `None` when either spec has no `location`

Combined (when a caller really does want one number):

- `full_distance(spec_a, spec_b)` → phonological + ancestry
- `weighted_full_distance(spec_a, spec_b)` → `WeightedDistance` with per-component breakdown
- `pairwise_distances(specs, metric)` → N×N distance matrix

### `feats.py`

Distinctive-feature matrix for IPA phones — `feats.py:1-683`:

Adapted from [PyPhone](https://github.com/lingz/pyphone) (MIT). Encodes a 21-feature SPE/IPA system. Used internally by `distance.py`.

- `vectorize_phones(phones)` — convert IPA string to feature vector — `feats.py:470`
- `is_vowel_phone(phone)` — check if a phone is a vowel — `feats.py:568`
- `phonetic_distance(phone_a, phone_b)` — segment-level distance — `feats.py:582`

### `transforms.py`

IPA dialect transform system for Portuguese and Ibero-Romance — `transforms.py:1-1000+`:

- `IPARule` — single IPA rewrite rule — `transforms.py:56`
- `IPAChainShift` — ordered chain of vowel/consonant shifts — `transforms.py:79`
- `IPALexicalRule` — orthography-conditioned IPA rule — `transforms.py:119`
- `DialectTransform` — named bundle of rules for a dialect — `transforms.py:145`
- `debias_lisbon(ipa, ortho)` — de-bias eSpeak PT-PT output to neutral standard — `transforms.py:168`
- `apply_transform(ipa, profile, ortho)` — apply a dialect profile — `transforms.py:855`
- `available_profiles()` — list registered dialect profile names — `transforms.py:938`
- `load_clup_profile(path)` — load a CLUP dialect profile — `transforms.py:972`
- `DIALECT_PROFILES` — dict of built-in profiles (Northern PT, Galician, Leonese, etc.)

### `script_distance.py`

Typological distance between writing systems — `script_distance.py:1-250`:

- `ScriptFeatures` — typological feature bundle for a writing system — `script_distance.py:30`
- `SCRIPT_REGISTRY` — built-in registry of script feature bundles
- `script_distance(a, b)` → float distance between two `ScriptFeatures` — `script_distance.py:191`
- `script_distance_by_name(a, b)` → float distance by script name strings — `script_distance.py:245`

### `sandhi.py`

Cross-word-boundary phonological rule engine — `sandhi.py:1-77`:

- `SandhiEngine` — applies `SandhiRule` objects across word boundaries — `sandhi.py:32`

### `lm.py`

Phoneme n-gram language model utilities — `lm.py:1-116`:

- `phoneme_embeddings(spec)` — 21-feature vectors for all phonemes — `lm.py:22`
- `build_ngram_lm(words, spec, n)` — build n-gram LM over IPA sequences — `lm.py:49`
- `perplexity(lm, test_words, spec, n)` — evaluate perplexity — `lm.py:79`

### Downstream engines

orthography2ipa is not an engine plugin host. Nothing here discovers or calls a
"G2P plugin", and the abstract base class that once implied otherwise is gone.

Rich, language-specific engines — **arbtok** (Arabic), **tugaphone** (Portuguese) —
are **consumers** of this library. They read its spec data, drive its lattice and
layer their own rescorers on top. That is the opposite direction from a plugin,
and conflating the two is what made "the plugin system" impossible to reason
about.

What *is* pluggable is a **step**: see `syllabifier_plugin.py` and
`rescorer_plugin.py`, and the contracts in `conformance.py`.

`WordContext` — the cross-word context an engine passes down — lives in
`sentence.py`, with the rest of the cross-word machinery.


### `syllabifier_plugin.py`

Abstract interface for per-language syllabifiers — `syllabifier_plugin.py:1-51`:

- `SyllabifierPlugin` — abstract base class with `syllabify(word, lang)`, `language_codes`, and `priority` — `syllabifier_plugin.py:28`

The bundled `stress.syllabify` is a naive vowel-group splitter. Languages with a real syllabifier ship it as a plugin (e.g. `silabificador` for Portuguese) and stress detection picks it up automatically.

Plugins are discovered lazily via `importlib.metadata` entry points in the `orthography2ipa.syllabify` group — `registry._discover_syllabifiers` — `registry.py:156`. Discovery runs once, on first call to `registry.get_syllabifier(code)`, and the result is cached at module scope. With no plugins installed, discovery returns an empty mapping and `get_syllabifier()` returns `None` for every code — this package ships no entry points of its own.

When several plugins claim the same language code, the one with the highest `priority` wins (default `50`).

A downstream package registers a syllabifier by declaring the entry point in its own `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[project.entry-points."orthography2ipa.syllabify"]
silabificador = "silabificador.plugin:PortugueseSyllabifier"
```

where `PortugueseSyllabifier` implements `SyllabifierPlugin` and declares `language_codes = ["pt-PT", "pt-BR"]`.

### `cli.py`

Command-line interface — `cli.py:1-200+`:

- `main(argv)` — entry point registered as `[project.scripts] orthography2ipa` — `cli.py:180`
- Subcommands: `list`, `info`, `transcribe`, `distance`
- All subcommands support `--json` for machine-readable output
- Imports are deferred to subcommand handlers for fast `--help` / `--version`

## Data Flow

```

      ▼
PhonetokTokenizer.tokenize()
  ├── Trie lookup (maximal munch) → GRAPHEME tokens
  ├── Regex matching → WHITESPACE, PUNCTUATION, DIGIT
  └── Fallback → UNKNOWN tokens
      │
      ▼
List[Token]  (each with .grapheme and .ipa tuple)

      ▼
PhonetokTokenizer.ipa_beam()
  ├── Resolve branches (positional + weight −log P)
  ├── Rescore (optional, B4)  → re-cost each slot given its neighbours
  └── Beam search over cartesian product of the (rescored) slot candidates
      │
      ▼
List[IPAPath]  (sorted by score, best first)
```

The **rescorer** stage is the downstream-enablement seam: it runs after
positional/weight resolution and before beam path selection, re-costing
each grapheme slot as a pure function of the slot and its context. A
downstream rule cascade — a sun-letter assimilation, a silent-`e` rule —
can be expressed as a rescorer over the shared lattice instead of a forked
tokenizer, when the rule is a context-conditioned choice among the
candidates the lattice already carries. See
[Rescoring the lattice](lattice.md#rescoring-the-lattice) and
[Refine or fork?](lattice.md#refine-the-lattice-or-fork-the-tokenizer) for
when each approach fits. Absent a rescorer, the pipeline is byte-identical.

The **allophony** stage is the built-in rescorer: a spec's declarative
`allophone_rules` (post-lexical `phoneme → surface` rewrites — final
devoicing, place assimilation, reduction, flapping) compile into an
`AllophoneRescorer` (`allophony.py`) the **engine** appends after any user
rescorer. In the full engine (`G2P`), the ordered stages are:

```
normalize → tokenize → select (positional + weights)
          → rescore (user rescorer(s) → allophony) → beam select
          → stress marks → sandhi → dialect transform
```

Allophony sits after phoneme selection and before stress/sandhi (it is the
phoneme-lattice → allophone-lattice stage), and needs the engine's stress
context, so — like sandhi and stress — it does not run on the standalone
tokenizer path. It is a no-op for any spec that declares no `allophone_rules`
(all shipped specs bar the Catalan pilots), keeping the default path
byte-identical. See [Allophony](allophony.md).

## Design Decisions

### Why frozen dataclasses?

`LanguageSpec`, `Ancestor`, `Token`, and `IPAPath` are all frozen. This ensures they can be safely shared across threads, cached with `lru_cache`, and used as dictionary keys or set members without unexpected mutation.

### Why JSON data files?

Language data was migrated from Python modules to JSON to separate linguistic data from code. JSON files can be reviewed, edited, and validated independently. Inheritance (`graphemes_base`, etc.) replaces Python `{**BASE, ...}` merge patterns.

### Why maximal munch for tokenization?

Maximal munch (longest match) is the standard strategy for tokenization in languages with digraphs and multigraphs. Portuguese `lh` should be matched as a single unit, not as `l` + `h`. The trie ensures this happens in O(k) time where k is the length of the longest grapheme key.

### Why beam search for IPA expansion?

The combinatorial explosion from ambiguous graphemes (e.g., English `c` → /k/ or /s/) makes exhaustive enumeration impractical for longer words. Beam search gives the N most-canonical paths efficiently, where "canonical" means using the first (most common) IPA value for each grapheme.

### Why lazy loading?

With 308 JSON data files, eager loading would make `import orthography2ipa` slow and memory-heavy. Lazy loading means only the languages actually used in a session are loaded. The registry is a pure dictionary lookup; no disk I/O until `get()` is called. — `registry.get` — `registry.py:68`

---

## Extending the Package

See [Adding a Language](adding_a_language.md) for the full guide. The short version:

1. Create `orthography2ipa/data/{code}.json` with the required fields (see `data/SCHEMA.md`).
2. For dialects, use `graphemes_base`/`allophones_base` to inherit from the parent.
3. Run the test suite to verify the spec validates correctly.
